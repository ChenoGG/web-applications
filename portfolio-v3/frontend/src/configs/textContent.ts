    It is a metaphor for life, growth, and the pursuit of peace For the Glory of Mankind. 
    To return to simplicity, to the being itself. 
    It is not only cultivating the land, but the soul.
    Each seed planted with the hopes of freeing the world from the scars of war.
    Each harvest a testament to the unending resilience and hope.`
