# Refactoring and component composition

## TODO:
- Add a Nav.tsx component for navigation. This can be kept simple as of writing this there is only one page.
- Add a Footer.tsx component to keep good semantics and for any "additional information" that might be displayed.
- Move hardcoded URLs and variables (like text) to their own config file. Important: Give descriptive names.
- Remove CardDisplayJsonData.tsx as it is no longer needed for displaying the JSON data (use initializeData() in DisplayProject.tsx to fetch instead)
- Add a ProjectStats.tsx component to count total projects made (move this logic from DisplayProject.tsx)
- Move remove project logic to DisplayProject.tsx from App.tsx
- Move add project logic to ProjectForm.tsx from App.tsx
